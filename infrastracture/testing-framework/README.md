# Testing Framework with Check

In this folder I will be playing with the Check tool designed by Arien Malec,
Branden Archer, Chris Pickett, Fredrik Hugosson, and Robert Lemmen. Their code
is available at [github](https://github.com/libcheck/check) and their project
page (and the tutorial I am following) is
[here](http://libcheck.github.io/check/).
